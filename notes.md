saving time: 5 years in a row

stars = coins = gold coin = currency

YOU --> need to find 50 coins
Why --> to pay room deposit
due by --> december 25th
1 puzzle= 1 star
--------------
Day 01
Elves -> require you to fix Expense report 

expense report = (your puzzle input)
math ain't adding up
Find 2 entries == 2020
x = ?
y = ?
expense report = x + y = 2020
product = x * y = ?

TIL: 
- in vim `J` joins 2 or more lines
- TIR: `%s/somethingOld/somethingNew/gc`  changes with confirmation

holy shit. I can't believe I submitted it right at midnight
I can't believe my thing worked ahhh!
It's the worst thing ever but omg.

Day 02
Th OTCP making it difficult for the little man by changing psw allowed.
db now corrupted
must debug

perline = policy + password
policy = validity of letter use = lowest + highest letter use eg 1-3 a = a, aa, aaa

data sample:
7-8 d: sgmddfddjrtv

min = 7
max = 8
val = d
psw = sgmddfddjrtv

Main question: how do i set up the data??
... i've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to format data

I am a fool who reset an accumulator at every iteration -_-

Part 2
policy = 1 means 1st char, 2 means 2nd char, etc.
no 0 index

Exactly ONE of these positions must contain the given letter. 
Other occurrences dont matter

444 too high
133 too low

dia tres

open squares (.)
trees (#)

pattern repeats many times to the right

(you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers)

start on (.) in top left corner
need to reach bottom-most row on map

toboggan (an ecological but inconvenient vehicle) that is, as you are, inclined
towards the rational

count all # (trees) of move -->3 and â†“1

start by counting all the trees you would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:

O == open .
X == there was a tree #

How many trees will you encounter??

90 is wrong
another number is wrong but i forgot to note it.. dang it.
I now see what I am doing is wrong. dang it.
99 is also wrong
78 is also wrong...
100 is also wrong.. but i expected that.. because I DIDNT READ WHAT MY CHANGE
EVEN DID. 

83 is also wrong, but I could tell from the output.. Idk why i submitted
anyway.. hope in happenstance perhaps.

125? WRONG. output is looking much better tho.
omg. I forgot I changed the data to check something.. nooo!
Yes! This works.

Part deux.
Right 1, down 1.
Right 3, down 1.
Right 5, down 1.
Right 7, down 1.
Right 1, down 2.

So. Is this how technical debt is acquired??
