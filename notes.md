1 puzzel = 1 star
--------------
Day 01
Elves -> require you to fix Expense report 

expense report = (your puzzle input)
math ain't adding up
Find 2 entries == 2020
x = ?
y = ?
expense report = x + y = 2020
product = x * y = ?

TIL: 
- in vim `J` joins 2 or more lines
- TIR: `%s/somethingOld/somethingNew/gc`  changes with confirmation
