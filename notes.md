--------------
Day 01
Elves -> require you to fix Expense report 

expense report = (your puzzle input)
math ain't adding up
Find 2 entries == 2020
x = ?
y = ?
expense report = x + y = 2020
product = x * y = ?

TIL: 
- in vim `J` joins 2 or more lines
- TIR: `%s/somethingOld/somethingNew/gc`  changes with confirmation

holy shit. I can't believe I submitted it right at midnight
I can't believe my thing worked ahhh!
It's the worst thing ever but omg.

Day 02
Th OTCP making it difficult for the little man by changing psw allowed.
db now corrupted
must debug

perline = policy + password
policy = validity of letter use = lowest + highest letter use eg 1-3 a = a, aa, aaa

data sample:
7-8 d: sgmddfddjrtv

min = 7
max = 8
val = d
psw = sgmddfddjrtv

Main question: how do i set up the data??
... i've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to format data

I am a fool who reset an accumulator at every iteration -_-

Part 2
policy = 1 means 1st char, 2 means 2nd char, etc.
no 0 index

Exactly ONE of these positions must contain the given letter. 
Other occurrences dont matter

444 too high
133 too low
